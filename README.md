# The Final WaveZ
(In Development)

This game was created in Unity as a final project for my Simulation and Game Development class. Since graduation I have returned to this project completely revamping it into a wave based shooter with an economy and upgrade system. I have been using my work on this game to push myself to learn more about game development with the aim to turn this project into a complete game that I plan to publish for mobile.
